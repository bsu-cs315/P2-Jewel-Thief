## Project Report

### Iteration 1 Reflection: 
For the most part this iteration was pretty simple. I had a little trouble getting started, mainly because I wasn't sure where to begin exactly. A lot of the ideas in the iteration were new to me in the sense that this is the first time I had used the kinematic motion opposed to the physics engine that was used in iteration one. Needless to say, this shift took a little to get used to but after watching a few videos and reading through some of the documentation I feel I found a pretty good starting point. Overall I look forward to continue to develop this iteration smoothening it out and making it better!
